## Project Overview

OpenDSA LTI Integration is a comprehensive implementation of Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) 1.3 with OAuth 2.0 and JWT authentication for the OpenDSA educational platform. This project enables seamless integration between OpenDSA and Virginia Tech's Learning Management System (LMS), providing secure single sign-on access and advanced interoperability features.

## Problem Statement

Educational institutions face significant challenges when integrating third-party learning tools:

- **Authentication Complexity**: Multiple login systems create user friction
- **Grade Synchronization**: Manual grade transfer processes are error-prone
- **User Management**: Maintaining separate user rosters across platforms
- **Security Concerns**: Ensuring secure data transmission between systems
- **Compliance Requirements**: Meeting educational data privacy standards

## Solution Architecture

### LTI 1.3 Advantage Implementation
Implemented the complete LTI 1.3 Advantage specification, including:

- **Names and Role Provisioning Services (NRPS)**: Automated user roster management
- **Assignment and Grade Services (AGS)**: Seamless grade synchronization
- **Deep Linking Services**: Dynamic content creation and assignment
- **Security Framework**: OAuth 2.0 with JWT token validation

### Authentication Flow

    U->>LMS: Access OpenDSA Content
    LMS->>OD: LTI Launch Request
    OD->>OD: Validate JWT Token
    OD->>DB: Check User Authorization
    OD->>U: Grant Access
    U->>OD: Complete Activities
    OD->>LMS: Send Grade Updates
    LMS->>U: Updated Gradebook
```

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Backend**: Python with Django framework
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized queries
- **API**: RESTful services with comprehensive documentation
- **Security**: HTTPS with certificate pinning

### Key Features

#### 1. Single Sign-On (SSO)
- **Seamless Authentication**: Users access OpenDSA without additional login
- **Session Management**: Secure token-based session handling
- **Role-based Access**: Automatic permission assignment based on LMS roles

#### 2. Grade Synchronization
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic grade transmission to LMS
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple grade updates
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry mechanisms for failed transmissions

#### 3. User Provisioning
- **Automatic Enrollment**: Users automatically added to appropriate courses
- **Role Mapping**: LMS roles translated to OpenDSA permissions
- **Profile Synchronization**: User information kept consistent across platforms

#### 4. Deep Linking
- **Dynamic Content**: Instructors can create assignments directly from LMS
- **Resource Selection**: Flexible content targeting for specific learning objectives
- **Custom Parameters**: Support for course-specific configurations

## Security Implementation

### OAuth 2.0 Flow
Implemented secure OAuth 2.0 authorization flow with:
- **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**: Enhanced security for public clients
- **State Parameter**: CSRF protection for authorization requests
- **Scope Management**: Granular permission control

### JWT Token Validation
- **Signature Verification**: Cryptographic validation of token authenticity
- **Expiration Handling**: Automatic token refresh mechanisms
- **Claims Validation**: Comprehensive verification of token contents

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
