With ChatGPT-5's enhanced capabilities, prompting has become both an art and a science. After extensive testing with the latest model, I've identified key strategies that consistently produce superior results.

## Principle 1: Start with the Problem, Not the Tool

With so many new AI tools (and features) emerging daily, it's tempting to get caught up in the hype and start trying them all out. But this is a mistake.

**The key is to begin with your actual problem, not the AI tool.**

* **Case in point**: When OpenAI announced **Custom GPTs**, they convinced many developers to spend time creating GPTs by making a big deal about monetization via the **GPT Store**. And yet, very little progress has been made.

## Essential Prompting Elements

### 1. Context Setting
Always provide sufficient context about your domain, constraints, and expected output format:

```
You are a senior software engineer reviewing a pull request. 
The codebase follows a microservices architecture using Node.js and PostgreSQL.
Please provide feedback on code quality, potential bugs, and architectural concerns.
```

### 2. Specific Output Formats
Be explicit about the structure you want:

```
Format your response as:
- **Summary**: One-line overview
- **Concerns**: List of issues found
- **Recommendations**: Specific actions to take
- **Code Examples**: If applicable
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement
The magic often happens in the second or third prompt:

**First prompt**: "Help me analyze this data"
**Second prompt**: "Focus specifically on trends and anomalies"
**Third prompt**: "Present findings in an executive summary format"

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain of Thought Prompting
Encourage step-by-step reasoning:

```
Think through this problem step by step:
1. Identify the core issue
2. Consider potential causes
3. Evaluate solution approaches
4. Recommend the best course of action
```

### Few-Shot Learning
Provide examples of the output you expect:

```
I need help categorizing customer feedback. Here are some examples:

Positive: "Love the new interface, much more intuitive"
Category: User Experience - Interface

Neutral: "The app works fine, no complaints"
Category: General - Neutral

Please categorize this feedback: "The loading time is too slow"
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being too vague**: "Help me improve my code"
2. **Providing no context**: Assumptions about domain knowledge
3. **Ignoring constraints**: Not mentioning limitations or requirements
4. **Single-shot thinking**: Expecting perfect results from one prompt

## Real-World Applications

### Code Review
```
As an experienced senior developer, review this JavaScript function for:
- Logic correctness
- Performance issues  
- Security vulnerabilities
- Code cleanliness

The function will be deployed to production with high traffic.
